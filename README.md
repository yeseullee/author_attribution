# author_attribution

# BoW
# 1. Start with finding documents with single authors.
# ->  singleauthors.py
# I used CiteSeerX.txt for it.
# Output is to output.txt

# 2. Take some portion like 75% to train. 
# This means find those documents and clean the text using txt_to_words function from bow.py
# And use CountVectorizer.

# 3. Take 25% to test.
# Take the documents, clean the text, and match to the closest one.

# 4. Find Z-score and confusion matrix.
